# Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-Papers
by [Pengfei Liu](http://pfliu.com/), [Jinlan Fu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=D4vtw8QAAAAJ) and other contributors.


An elaborate and exhaustive paper list for Named Entity Recognition (NER),
covering papers from seven top conferences (*ACL / EMNLP / NAACL / Coling / ICLR / AAAI / IJCAI*)  and eight years (*2013-2020*).

## What can I get here?
* Get to know [Potential Research Concepts &#x1F53D;](https://github.com/pfliu-nlp/Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-Papers/blob/master/ner_concept.md) of recent NER work
* A fancy [**Paper Viewing System [Click Me !!!]** &#x1F53D;](http://pfliu.com/ner/ner.html), in which you can:
	* Find the **top-cited** NER-papers, which are generally worth reading!! [The latest update on: 01.05/2020]
	* Find the **latest** NER-papers, which reflect the trend of development!
	* Searching papers with keywords that you're interested in
	* Knowing which papers are covered by a given research point
* Mainstream [NER Datasets &#x1F53D;](https://github.com/pfliu-nlp/Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-Papers/blob/master/ner_dataset.md)


## What can I do here?
* ### If you have a new "research point"?  -- Tell us
	* **Update** the file [`ner_concept.md`](https://github.com/pfliu-nlp/Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-Papers/blob/master/ner_concept.md) and `Pull requests`
	* Or you could directly propose an `Issues`


* ### If you have a new "paper" or more reasonable annotations?
	* **Add** your paper (If possible, with annotated concepts) into [`paper_with_concept`](https://github.com/pfliu-nlp/Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-Papers/blob/master/paper_with_concept) and `Pull requests`
	* Or you could directly propose an `Issues`


* ### If you have a new "dataset"?
	* **Add** your dataset (If possible, with brief description) into [`ner_data`](https://github.com/pfliu-nlp/Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-Papers/tree/master/ner_dataset) and `Pull requests`
	* Or you could directly propose an `Issues`




## Acknowledgments
* This project is a by-product of this work [``Rethinking Generalization of Neural Models: A Named Entity Recognition Case Study``](http://pfliu.com/InterpretNER/rethink-ner.pdf), whose recognition by this community motivates us a lot to set up such a summary.
* Thanks [Graham Neubig](http://www.phontron.com/)'s idea on the "concept" and other comments.
