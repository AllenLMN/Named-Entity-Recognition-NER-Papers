# Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-Papers
An elaborate and exhaustive paper list for Named Entity Recognition (NER),
covering papers from seven top conferences (ACL/EMNLP/NAACL/Coling/ICLR/AAAI/IJCAI)  and eight years (2013-2020).

## What can I get here?
* Get to know [Potential Research Points](https://github.com/pfliu-nlp/Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-Papers/blob/master/ner_research_point.md) of recent NER work
* A fancy [Paper Viewing System](http://pfliu.com/ner/ner.html), in which you can:
	* Find the **top-cited** NER-papers, which are generally worth reading!!
	* Find the **latest** NER-papers, which reflect the trend of development!
	* Searching papers with keywords that you're interested in
	* Knowing which papers are covered by a given research point
* Mainstream [NER Datasets](https://github.com/pfliu-nlp/Named-Entity-Recognition-NER-Papers/blob/master/ner_dataset.md)


## What can I do here?
* ### If you have a new "research point"?  -- Tell us
	* **Update** the file `ner_research_point.md` and `Pull requests`
	* Or you could directly propose a `Issues`


* ### If you have a new "paper"?
	* **Add** your paper (If possible, with annotated concepts) into `ner_research_point.md` and `Pull requests`
	* Or you could directly propose a `Issues`
